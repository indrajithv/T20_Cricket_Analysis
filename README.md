# T20 Cricket Analysis

This project involves creating a Power BI Dashboard to identify the top 11 players for a T20 cricket team. The data is scraped from espncricinfo using a Brightdata website tool, then cleaned and transformed with pandas. Various player performance metrics are evaluated to select the best team composition.

## Overview

In T20 cricket, team composition plays a critical role in determining success. This project aims to leverage data analytics to identify the top-performing players across different categories and ultimately select the optimal team lineup for a T20 match.

## Methodology

The project follows a structured methodology:

1. **Data Collection**:
   - Scraping data from espncricinfo using a Brightdata website tool to gather player statistics and performance metrics.

2. **Data Cleaning and Transformation**:
   - Cleaning and preprocessing the scraped data using pandas to ensure consistency and accuracy.
   - Transforming the data into a format suitable for analysis and visualization.

3. **Performance Evaluation**:
   - Evaluating various player performance metrics such as batting average, strike rate, bowling economy, fielding efficiency, etc.
   - Analyzing player performance across different match formats (T20, ODI, Test) and conditions.

4. **Power BI Dashboard Creation**:
   - Creating a Power BI Dashboard to visualize player statistics, performance trends, and team composition.
   - Utilizing interactive features of Power BI to facilitate data exploration and decision-making.

5. **Team Selection**:
   - Using the Power BI Dashboard to select players for various roles/categories such as openers, middle order/anchors, finishers, all-rounders, and specialist fast bowlers.
   - Formulating the final team lineup based on the selected players with a focus on achieving a balanced team composition.

6. **Outcome Prediction**:
   - Assessing the team's chances of winning the match based on the selected lineup, aiming for a high probability of success (e.g., 90%).

## Implementation

The project is implemented using Python for data scraping, cleaning, and transformation, along with Power BI for dashboard creation and visualization. The Brightdata website tool facilitates web scraping, while pandas provides powerful data manipulation capabilities.

## Conclusion

By leveraging data analytics and visualization techniques, this project facilitates the selection of the best T20 cricket team lineup. The Power BI Dashboard provides valuable insights into player performance, enabling informed decision-making to maximize the team's chances of winning.
